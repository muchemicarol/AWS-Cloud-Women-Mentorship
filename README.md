## AWS Cloud Women Mentorship Program
The theme for **World TB Day 2024** is **"Yes! We can end TB"**. Innovations for the detection and treatment of TB play a crucial role in eradicating the TB epidemic. As a data scientist and aspiring machine learning engineer, I look to join hands in this through leveraging on my professional experience and  tapping into the available AI tools to help in this fight to **#EndTB**. Tuberculosis is the fourth leading cause of death in Kenya.

This repository aims to achieve early detection of tuberculosis using advanced image processing. For this project, I am leveraging on AWS Cloud ML tools and technique.
